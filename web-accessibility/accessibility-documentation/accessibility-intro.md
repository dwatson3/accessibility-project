When we tend to think of the word diversity,the word is applied to a wide range of people, varying in color, religion, or creed. However, a part of our diverse population that tends to be forgotten about are people with disabilities. 

	In popular tech culture, the word diversity is a topic surrounding white women and people of color (in much fewer amounts). However, people with disabilities are also a component of diversity. 

In a study of 100 websites, the United Nations commissioned an audit to find out how many websites were accessible for people with disabilities. The results of this study found only 3 of 100 websites met international standards for accessibility. This can only lead us to this conclusion: people with disabilities are largely unable to access the internet.

We are living in the times of a social media fixation - ranging from popular websites such as Ted Talks, YouTube,Netflix, and more. Most of the these podcasts and videos on popular social media websites are produced without captions or transcripts. 

We can create a more tolerant and inclusive internet culture by striving to create and modify existing websites to become more accessible for people with disabilities.

This starts by having software development teams learn how to make accessible websites. Most of disabled users have challenges when using keyboards, mouses, and speakers - as an alternative using screen readers are commonly used to experience and interact with websites. 

One major way to incorporate web accessibility into websites is to learn WAI-ARIA, which stands for “Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications.” A great resource to learn more about these standards, can be found here. 

Another ever-growing discussion of web accessibility that needs to be featured more: making a commitment to providing multilingual websites, therefore attracting more users and the larger audience. Globalization is and will continue to have a larger vast of influence on internet users.

To create more business and foot traffic to your website, make the first effort by offering diverse languages for diverse users.

The U.S. technology industry is not as inclusive as it should be. In order to stay progressive, more of our websites need to scale to meet a larger and diverse global audience.

People with disabilities tend to be kept hidden in our society and popular culture. Our larger global audience of speakers tend to be forgotten about as well. As we strive to improve diversity in internet culture - we must be sure to include everyone, including people with disabilities.
