When we tend to think of the word diversity, we generally apply the word to a range of people with various creeds, colors, and religions. However, a part of the population that tends to be forgotten are people with disabilities. 

In popular tech culture, the word “diversity” is a topic surrounding white women, and people of color in much fewer amounts. However, people with disabilities are a component of diversity as well. 

In a study of 100 websites, the United Nations commissioned an audit to find out how many websites were accessible for people with disabilities. The results of this study found that only 3 of 100 websites met the international standard for accessibility. This can only lead us to this conclusion: people with disabilities are unable to access the internet.

The world’s disabled population accounts for about 15%. When you improve the universal design of your website, this improves the user experience for both people with (and without) disabilities. 

We are living in the heart of popular social media exploding - ranging from popular websites such as Ted Talks, YouTube, and Netflix. However, most of the these podcasts and videos are produced without captions or transcripts. 

We can create a more tolerant and inclusive internet culture by striving to create and modify existing websites to become more accessible for people with disabilities.

This starts by having software development teams learn how to make web accessible sites. Most of disabled users have challenges when using keyboards, mouses, and speakers - as an alternative using screen readers are commonly used to experience and interact with websites. 

One major way to incorporate web accessibility into websites is to learn WAI-ARIA, which stands for “Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications.” A great resource to learn more about these standards, can be found here. 

Another aspect of web accessibility that is becoming popular - making a commitment to providing multilingual websites to attract more users and a larger audience. The impact of globalization is on the rise, and will only continue to have a larger vast of influence.

U.S. tech culture is not inclusive of reaching out to the larger global audience, which is behind in the current times and is becoming more of an issue.

To create more business and foot traffic to your website, make the first effort by offering diverse languages for diverse users. 



People with disabilities tend to be kept hidden in our society and popular culture. As we strive to improve diversity in internet culture - we must be sure to include everyone, including people with disabilities.
