This web application is focused on Web Accessibility - the practice of improving access to websites for people with disabilities. 

I built this full-stack web application, as well as the written tutorials on web accessibility friendly APIs, and other web features software developers can incorporate into their own projects. 

The four tutorials include demos and tutorials on:

1. A combination of using the Google Speech-to-Text API with the Twilio API, taking in audio speech and sending out text messages to a mobile phone device.

2. Using the Google Speech-to-Text API to compose an email by speaking into your computer microphone.

3. Google Translation plug-in for the creation of multi-lingual websites.

4. WAI-ARIA standards you can incorporate into your website for low-vision and blind users, who may require screenreader software.
